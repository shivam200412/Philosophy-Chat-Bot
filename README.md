## üìñ Overview

Philosophy Chatbot is a smart assistant capable of answering questions about philosophy based on embedded knowledge from philosophical texts. It uses:

- **LangChain** for building the RetrievalQA pipeline  
- **FAISS** for fast semantic search over embedded documents  
- **HuggingFace** for embedding and LLM access  
- **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface  

The chatbot sticks to facts and avoids hallucinating answers outside of the provided content. If it doesn't know the answer, it simply says so.
